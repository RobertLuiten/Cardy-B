I’ve advanced environmental and racial justice imperatives to create a $20m Climate Equity program that funds green home energy conversions and new affordable housing. As the UW’s Director of Policy, Planning & State Operations, I implemented paid family and medical leave, and championed legislation that delivered affordable higher education to thousands of students.King County is bigger than 15 other states, we have the responsibility to lead on issues from homelessness to transit to climate change.I will bring my experience getting things done at the County to ensure we protect our environment, advance equity, and grow our economy. Helping the unhoused is an urgent priority, we must scale up supportive services that save lives and build healthy communities for everyone. We need safe, reliable public transportation throughout District 4, which is why I’ve proposed a Transportation Benefit District for the county. I will also increase investments in renewable energy and green development in public and private projects to ensure our region, and world, are livable for generations to come.Together, we can make real progress for our families, neighbors, and communities in District 4, and I would be honored to earn your vote.Endorsements: National Women’s Political Caucus, King County Young Democrats, UW Young Democrats, Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz, County Councilmember Joe McDermott, State Representatives: Liz Berry and Kristine Reeves, community leaders Dorothy Bullitt and Cary Moon, Seattle City Councilmember Lisa Herbold, Former City Councilmembers Nick Licata and Abel Pacheco, King Conservation District Supervisor Csenka Favorini-Csorba, and dozens of local business, nonprofit, and community leaders.",

We have fought to protect senior homeowners from soaring values, make it easier to get your refund, and see how much that ballot measure is going to cost. But more should be done. That’s why I am asking for your vote again. I’ll fight for a truly fair and equitable property tax system. We’re in a housing crisis. Housing affordability threatens everyone – whether homeowners, seniors, renters or small business owners. Our homeless crisis leaves women and children to sleep out on the street because there is no room in the shelter. An “activist” Assessor can help. We’ve gone twice to Olympia to reform the senior and disabled property tax relief program. Now thousands of our neighbors can stay in their homes. Responding to our homelessness crisis, we found surplus public and vacant private property, which can be used for housing solutions. We have identified the land. We should put it to use. The housing shortage makes homes and apartments in King County so expensive. Smarter density can bring us more housing at a more affordable price. But our property tax system was never designed to handle annual assessed value increases of up to just over 50%. And while actual taxes, including those voter approved, are considerably less, in these inflationary times it literally hits home. I’ve been a tireless taxpayer champion. Homeowners, renters, and small businesses deserve a tax break. I'm working with Assessors statewide to save everyday people real money without gutting vital local services. I am proud to be endorsed by Democrats and Republicans, labor and business, and folks in Seattle and the suburbs. While much has been done, we must do more. I ask for your vote.",

I bring a passion for fostering an inclusive and transparent democratic process. Under my leadership, both our voting system and community outreach have been modernized to enhance accessibility and voter participation. The Voter Education Fund has set a new model of community partnership by providing funds and training to community organizations doing non-partisan voter registration and education in historically marginalized communities. I’ve increased the number of ballot drop boxes from 10 to nearly 80 and advocated in Olympia and in D.C. to ensure every person has meaningful access to their right to vote. I have brought in experts from the Department of Homeland Security to audit our practices and increase security. I have partnered with leaders of both political parties to ensure consistent, bipartisan oversight of our elections. We have developed an incredible team of trained, professional election administrators who work tirelessly to ensure absolutely every ballot has been counted and is accounted for. As we move forward, I remain committed to improving our voting experience and maintaining a steadfast, transparent, and nonpartisan department. Thank you for participating in our democratic process and exercising your right to vote. I ask for your vote and your continued support as we forge a path forward together.",

The skyrocketing cost of living is forcing people to work double shifts to pay for half the groceries. The lack of affordable homes has pushed our neighbors to live on street corners. Staffing shortages have led countless people to live in crisis without the immediate attention of first responders. In my first four years on the Council, my team and I have led major efforts to address these problems. My office formulated and passed one of the largest investments in mental health and addiction recovery in our state’s history with the Crisis Care Centers initiative. My office uplifted Skyway, leading to unprecedented investment in this neighborhood’s housing, transit, and community infrastructure. My office championed the building of thousands of homes across King County by co-sponsoring Health through Housing, home ownership initiatives, Tiny House villages, the Youth Achievement Center, and more. My office passed historic tenant protections to keep people in their homes in the wake of a global pandemic. My office created new gun violence prevention strategies to reduce the shootings in key areas around the district. These are just a fraction of our efforts but much more is needed. I am running for a second term on the King County Council to continue the work of keeping our communities safe, housed, and healthy.

As soon as I was sworn in for my term in January of 2020, this was put to the test. COVID-19 was a once-in-a-generation pandemic that truly shook the foundations of our society. We saw chaos in supply chain logistics and travel through the airport came to a screeching halt.  I’m proud that despite COVID-19, the port weathered the pandemic without laying off a single port employee and saved every small and minority dining and retail tenant at the airport from going out of business. We were able to do this because we made principled decisions that put people first. Despite the pandemic, we were able to invest in the airport to get upgraded from 3 to 4-stars by Skytrax and we won “Best Airport in North America” in 2022 and 2023. We were also the only port on the west coast to add container terminal space during the pandemic. I have worked tirelessly to ensure the growth and economic prosperity of King County, promote sustainability, and combat human trafficking. I’m asking for 4 more years because the job’s not finished. In a post-pandemic world, we must build the “port of the future.” A future where we create the next generation of strong family wage jobs; A future where we are the greenest port in North America; A future where we usher in new technologies such as hydrogen and offshore wind. With your support, we can build a port of the future that we can all be proud of.  Endorsed by over 50 local elected leaders, Seattle Building Trades, ILWU, Washington Conservation Action, King County Democrats and many others.",

I hope to continue working on behalf of residents as Mayor. I firmly believe in our city’s bright future and want to help it grow. My wife and I have lived in the area for 40+ years and in Algona for 17. Our children and grandchildren also live here, inspiring me to work towards the Algona’s future. I served on City Council for seven years, becoming Mayor in January. I’ve supported: resolving flooding via storm drain improvement and cleaning the Highway 167 ditch; improving city streets; upgrading old water and sewer lines; and developing housing and parks. Strong leadership will embrace the future while protecting the character of our “small city with a big heart.",
